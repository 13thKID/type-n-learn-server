Created associations between Set and User

1. Created an association between Set and User
tables using 'authorId' property
2. User's auto incremented ID changed to UUID type
3. Created auto-generated 'slug' for the Set model
which is created from the name given
4. Upgraded validation: Now it can be viewed in two
steps:
  4.1 Via Policy-middleware, which must follow the 
  model constraints
  4.2 Via Sequelize and check for no duplicates
5. Set seeder were upgraded with auto-populating 
'authorId' field
6. Config file was splitted into node-env modes
7. Authentication middleware first step was finished:
  Now, express automatically sends http-only cookie
  to the client-side and accepts it via Auth-middleware.
  If no cookie is in the header, authentication can be
  done via token, passed in the auth-header 
8. Configuration of the CORS policy
